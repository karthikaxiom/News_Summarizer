## 🧠 Model Details
### Summarization
- The summarization model extracts key details from news articles using BeautifulSoup for web scraping.

### Sentiment Analysis
- Sentiment analysis is performed using TextBlob to categorize the sentiment as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.

### Text-to-Speech (TTS)
- The TTS model uses Google Translator to translate text to Hindi and gTTS to convert the translated text to speech.

## 🌐 API Development
### Endpoints
- **`/fetch-news`**: Fetches news articles related to a given company.
- **`/analyze-sentiment`**: Analyzes the sentiment of the fetched news articles.
- **`/compare-news`**: Compares the sentiment across the fetched news articles.
- **`/generate-tts`**: Generates a text-to-speech (TTS) output for the provided text.

### Accessing APIs
- Use tools like Postman to test the APIs. Provide the company name as a query parameter.

## 🔗 API Usage
### Third-Party APIs
- **NewsAPI**: Used to fetch news articles.
  - **API Key**: Store the API key in an environment variable.

## ⚠️ Assumptions & Limitations
- The application assumes that the NewsAPI will return relevant articles for the given company name.
- The sentiment analysis is based on the summary of the articles and may not reflect the full content.
- The TTS output is generated in Hindi and may have limitations in pronunciation and accuracy.

## 🚀 Deployment
- The application is deployed on Hugging Face Spaces. https://huggingface.co/spaces/karthik808/News_Summarizer
